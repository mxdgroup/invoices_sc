# Proforma Invoice Setup - Summary

## âœ… What Was Done

I've successfully set up the proforma invoice generation system based on your HTML template. Here's what was created:

### 1. **New Files Created**

#### `/home/kali/pdf_script/generate_proforma_invoice.py`
- Core logic for generating proforma invoice HTML from JSON data
- Handles VAT-inclusive pricing calculations
- Automatically calculates:
  - Total discount
  - Total excluding VAT
  - Total VAT amount
  - Total including VAT
  - Advance payment (50% of total)

#### `/home/kali/pdf_script/fast_api_invoice_server/sample_proforma_request.json`
- Sample request based on your HTML template (Invoice #00PI25-00000002)
- Shows the exact JSON structure needed
- Ready to use for testing

#### `/home/kali/pdf_script/fast_api_invoice_server/PROFORMA_INVOICE_USAGE.md`
- Complete documentation for the proforma invoice feature
- Includes field descriptions, examples, and calculation logic
- Shows differences between tax invoices and proforma invoices

#### `/home/kali/pdf_script/fast_api_invoice_server/test_proforma.py`
- Test script for easy testing
- Usage: `python test_proforma.py`

### 2. **Modified Files**

#### `main.py`
- Added import for `generate_proforma_invoice` module
- Created new Pydantic models for proforma invoices:
  - `ProformaInvoiceInfo`
  - `ProformaIssuedTo`
  - `ProformaTerms`
  - `ProformaItem`
  - `ProformaInvoiceRequest`
- Added new endpoint: `/generate-proforma-invoice`

## ðŸš€ How to Use

### 1. Start the Server

```bash
cd /home/kali/pdf_script/fast_api_invoice_server
python main.py
```

### 2. Test the Proforma Invoice

#### Option A: Using the test script
```bash
python test_proforma.py
```

#### Option B: Using cURL
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/generate-proforma-invoice" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer your-secret-token-here" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d @sample_proforma_request.json
```

### 3. Sample Request Structure

```json
{
  "invoice": {
    "number": "00PI25-00000002",
    "date_of_issuing": "October 12, 2025"
  },
  "issued_to": {
    "name": "Customer Name",
    "address": "Full address",
    "trn": "",
    "email": "customer@example.com"
  },
  "terms": {
    "payment_terms": "Advance payment of 50% before Delivery"
  },
  "items": [
    {
      "description": "Product name",
      "sub_description": "Optional SKU or details",
      "quantity": 1.0,
      "uom": "Pcs",
      "price_incl_vat_aed": 36493.00,
      "discount_pct": 20,
      "vat_pct": 5
    }
  ],
  "amount_in_words": "Total in words",

## ðŸ“Š Example Calculation

Given:
- Price (Incl. VAT): 36,493.00 AED
- Quantity: 1
- Discount: 20%
- VAT: 5%

Calculation:
1. **Gross** = 36,493.00 Ã— 1 = 36,493.00
2. **Discount** = 36,493.00 Ã— 20% = 7,298.60
3. **Amount (Incl. VAT)** = 36,493.00 - 7,298.60 = 29,194.40
4. **Amount (Excl. VAT)** = 29,194.40 / 1.05 = 27,804.19
5. **VAT Amount** = 29,194.40 - 27,804.19 = 1,390.21
